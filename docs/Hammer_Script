# Hammer Script

## Overview

Hammer defines a language for manipulating the key objects within.  Each type 
of object is manipulated with command script.  The data types are nouns within 
the system.  Each noun can support several operations.


## Command Scripts

All of the command scripts are located in the **bin** directory.  Each command
script is a bash script that invokes a python script to act on the arguments 
passed in.

Every command has a **test** and **help** operation.  If an illegal command is
attempted then the help text is shown to help train the user on the proper
interactions.
