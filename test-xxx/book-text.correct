# Build a culture of Leverage

## Culture and world view

My father is a cultural anthropologist. I grew up on stories of strange
customs that other people had. A recurring theme was understanding why people
do seemingly irrational things. The answers can be found by understanding the
culture and the world view that drives it.

Later, when I entered the world of high-tech I found another strange culture
was at play.  A strong world view applied to everything we did.  Those that
violated the code were severely punished. A some were deeds would cause active
banishment for life.

While readily adopting this world view, I remained puzzled over many  of the
inconsistencies that were present.  The rules are seldom recorded but strictly
enforced by everyone in the community.

Some communities actually do document their world view to help newcomers
understand.  The HP Way and the Python Code of Conduct, both describe in
principle that are valued and the practices that they demand.  This can be
really helpful to avoid a cultural blunders.

In order to build or change a culture you must truly understand what drives
it. Lets explore the high-tech culture and see how we can affect a positive
change.  We will study the believes that drive behavior in order to influence
the harmful dysfunction that we see. This is the only path possible to
meaningful change.


## Belief systems

Cultures are driven by a world view. A person's world view is unseen by them
until someone opposes it. There is a reality that is readily embraced and
never questioned.  One of the extremely difficult things about adolescence is
that we must grapple with these world-view issues in order to embrace
adulthood.

An entire world view is supported by specific paradigms, which each provide a
fundamental understanding of the world.  A common mental model allows everyone
in the community to be aligned, by sharing the same beliefs. We believe that
all normal and decent people think the same way.

We choose to be a part of a community because we share a large number of
paradigms with them.  We resonate with the ideas that are shared and are
repelled by those we don't.

Let me illustrate this with two examples. The open source community believes
that sharing is good. It is a self-evident truth that ideas should be readily
exchanged with little thought to collecting money.  While the fortune 500
culture this in terms of thievery of intellectual property.  Every thought is
owned and must be accounted for.

Which one is right?  They are opposing paradigms.  It will depend on which
community you are drawn to. Once you make this choice it becomes very
difficult to function under another paradigm.

Some cultures promote sharing of information. People are rewarded for helping
others and furthering the cause of understanding. In other cultures, people
are rewarded for knowing more than anyone else.  Most academic and corporate
environment discourage any helping of others as a loss of personal advantage.

The corporate environment where I spend the bulk of my career was based on a
forced ranking of employees doing the same job. Helping someone else might
move you from a 62% rating to a 60%. Employees would actively sabotage the
success of others in subtle but constant ways.


## Revolution

What happens when we find ourselves in an organization where we don't share
the accepted paradigms? This really depends on the level of the disconnect.
Any rejection of a paradigm will make you an outsider.

If you do not share the world view as a whole you are not even a member of the
community.  You never will be and you need to find your community elsewhere.
But what if you share most of the beliefs but not all?  Is there enough
connection to stay?

If you find yourself at odds with a single set of believes you only have
several choices:

* Surrender - Realize that there are enough other things that are good that 
you are willing to put up with the constant foolishness.
* Adopt - You might take on the beliefs of the community in order to be at 
peace and in time begin to believe that way.
* Adapt - Sometimes the practices can be changed without challenging the 
underlying belief system. This is how I brought Agile software development 
into my working teams at HP.
* Challenge - Some beliefs need to be changed. Constantly pointing out the 
dysfunction requires a tremendous amount of courage. Be ready for the 
slap-down that is reserved for agitators.
* Revolt - As a last resort you might consider building a power network of 
like-minded people that will band together to overturn the current thinking. 
This requires carefully thinking through both the technical and cultural 
challenges that you are facing.


## Call to action

Recognizing the disconnect is the most important step. Is there enough for you
to work with or are you better off moving?  Not every battle is worth fighting
and you must limit your efforts to one or two key issues.

But all of this should be a very conscious decision. Whether you leave or stay
and fight you choose, rather than someone else. Many people just feel trapped,
which is nothing more than the Surrender option. Don't choose that by default,
when you have other options.

Once you have identified an issue that you need to address, you are ready to
choose your response.  What role is you best path forward?  Consider answering
the following questions:

* How much energy are you willing to invest in order to change the issue?
* Who are the people that share my beliefs and what are they willing to do 
as allies?
* How deep does the change have to go in order to get a good outcome?
* What types of resources can I apply to affect the change?
* What kind of trust do I have within the community?
* Am I better off to just ignore the issue or is it an absolute "deal breaker"?
* What possible paths could I take and what are the likely outcome?

These are extremely difficult questions to answer. But the conflict is already
there and you are simply figuring out the best way to resolve it.  Choose a
path that is consistent with your career goals.

Some people fight about everything, and others will never choose to rock the
boat. Choose a role that matches your personal growth.  Who do you want to
become? A person is largely determined by the struggles that they engage in.

Finally, enjoy the ride.  Consider the adventure.  You have the making of a
great story line.  You have the battle for right and wrong, with allies and
enemies, with some important objective at risk.  Celebrate you victories and
mourn your losses. Be a hero!


## What is culture?

### Culture happens

Culture is made up of unwritten rules of conduct.  It is how a community
identifies its members. Maybe more importantly, the rules of conduct are able
to point out outsiders. It is extremely difficult to feel a part of a
community that is different than the one you grew up with.

Strong community enforcement is applied to anyone that violates the rules. It
is very difficult to infiltrate a new culture. Think about the last time you
integrated new people into your team. These were people raised in a very
similar culture. But it probably took considerable energy to show them "how
things are really done here".

The code of conduct is built on a set of rules, which are created by people in
the group. The group itself is unwilling to compromise on these values because
they are considered to represent the right way to do things...  The only right
way!

There may be hundreds of rules in the culture or just a few.  Some cultures
actually write down the rules. Examples include the Python Code of Conduct, or
the HP Way. This is extremely valuable because it focuses the attention on the
most important rules.


### Crafting your culture

Culture happens automatically wherever there is a group of earthlings. Culture
is a direct results of trying to resolve conflict. Over time each of the
trade-offs made result in a new rule. "From now on no code will be committed
without passing the unit tests. If you break the build you have to be the
build master."

Everyone wants a great culture. But that is not an easy thing to create. It
requires more than lip-service. Culture crafting takes years and requires
sophisticated understanding of the politics of power. I recommend that you
start by assessing the cultural elements that you would like to change most.

Few companies invest the level that they should to shape the culture. Some
half-hearted attempts to improve the culture can make things significantly
worse. I recall spending significant time working on a plan to improve the
results from a "voice of the workplace" survey.

We presented the top five recommendations to our management staff. Every
suggestion that was recommended was rejected, because it would cost money.
The morale of every employee plummeted as a result. The message was clear.
"We do not really care what you think. Just do your work and quit whining."

It would have been far better to admit up front that the real issues that
affect our work culture can not be addressed at this point due to market
realities. At least that is honest.

When you are on hold having a message saying that your call is important fools
not one.  If the call was important then there would be someone to talk to me. 
Do not make this mistake.

Culture can be crafted, but it takes work.  It takes focused vision and
perseverance. But the rewards are huge. I believe that the reason companies
like Google, Microsoft, and Apple are so successful is related to the culture
that they have created.


### Return on investment

If companies spent 10% of all their time trying to build a culture of
excellence, the impact could be enormous.  Most organizations that I've 
worked in would experience between 30% to 100% increase in innovation.

Smart people want to win. The role of culture in an organization is that
it creates and opportunity for people to excel.  How much of our energy is 
wasted, squandered by the limited thinking in our culture.

Selecting the desired changes you want careful.  Not every battle is worth
fighting. Change one thing at a time. Start with the biggest ROI. Everything
else can wait.

Managing change requires building momentum. This is especially hard if your
organization has a history of waste and mis-management.  Pick a small thing
and get a quick win. Then use this as an opportunity for future gains.

Build allies of like-minded people.  These could be people in the standard
reporting structure or simply people that want to make a difference. Meet 
regularly to review the progress and identify next steps.


## How to build the culture you want

### The impact of culture

Organizations vary dramatically in performance. The most admired company of
our age is probably Google.  The level of productivity that they have is
phenomenal and unequaled. This is a direct result of there culture. They can
recruit the very best and unleash them on complex problems.

Jim Collins wrote a book entitled "How the Mighty Fall". He described how
successful companies have no guarantee of remaining successful. A great
company can forget to do the very things that made it great in the first
place. This begins a slow and inevitable downward spiral of dysfunction. If
left unchecked a fortune 100 company will close its doors.

Construct a cycle of acceleration that reverses this decay.  You can not
address the needs of a whole company, but you can bring light and health to
your local team. Even highly dysfunctional organizations can recognize
successful results. Use the visibility and credibility to leverage the success
to a larger scope.

You can make a difference. Use your influence to make it better for everyone.
Software architecture requires more that technical skills.  It requires 
leadership. Leave your footprints wherever you go. Fix problems and resolve 
conflicts. It takes courage to move into the breach but it is worth it.

That is true leverage!


### Essential elements of culture

There are several areas of culture that determine the amount of leverage that
your projects will have.  Each of these areas should be designed to give you
the results that you need. Think of each of these areas a cultural pillar.
Together they provide a high-performance platform for your projects.

Building these areas falls beyond the context of the product development.
Consider building your culture a meta-project that supports all of your
projects. Seek to leverage the culture beyond the scope of a single project.
Build a long-term history of success that you will leverage on all future
projects.

Measurement

Metrics lie at the heart of all process improvement. If you can measure it you
can optimize it. Establish key analytics that both confirm your understanding
and provide additional insights. Build measurement tools that bring data 
to your with
minimal effort.

Learning

The most important thing a team can do is learn.  It is foundational to 
everything else you do. Understand how the internet has changed how we learn
and the new dynamics that our organizations face. Create a process for 
managing your personal and team skills using the Dreyfus model.

Process

How do you manage the tasks involved with building your software? How do the
developers collaborate and how are the finished services deployed? Having a
master plan for your process can lead to leverage opportunities. Gain significant
productivity by embracing standards in strategic places.

Tools

The tools chain for our development has become increasingly complex. This
section discusses the dynamics of building a modern stack of technologies. You
must  carefully define when you build or buy technologies.  How often should
you switch tools to keep abreast of changes?
